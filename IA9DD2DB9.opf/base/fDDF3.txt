the English text),85 as well as commentaries by Vilāsavajra86 and Vimalamitra.87

↑ Note that as far as we can presently determine, the title (Ārya)-mañjuśrīnāmasaṅgīti does
not appear to be attested in original Sanskrit sources and can only be found in Tibetan renderings
of the Sanskrit title or in modern literature. The tantra’s most common title in
Sanskrit is simply Nāmasaṅgīti (‘Chanting the Names’), while the colophons to the tantra itself
generally give the full title as Bhagavato Mañjuśrījñānasattvasya Paramārthā Nāmasaṅgītiḥ
(‘The Supreme Chanting of the Names of the Blessed One Mañjuśrī, the Wisdom Deity’).↑
The chapter titles are included in many but not all witnesses of the Nāmasaṅgīti and its
translations. Commentators employ them to explain the structure of the text. They are generally
not chanted aloud by contemporary practitioners who recite the text.↑ Some witnesses
of the ancient translations have an alternative reading (pad+ma rgyas pa’i gdan la bzhungs),
which can be translated ‘seated atop a seat that is a lily in full bloom’.↑ ‘Illusion’s
Net’ can be understood as a proper name referring to the Māyājālatantra and the tantric
system presented therein. Various esoteric and non-esoteric glosses of this name are possible:
for example, Vimalamitra states that the word hints at the unity of a special form of
insight and means.↑ The ‘three forms of unwanted birth’ are birth in hell, as a hungry ghost,
or as an animal.↑ Vimalamitra, as well as most witnesses we have consulted of the Nāmasaṅgīti’s
Tibetan translations, indicates that ‘the lord of speech’ is the Buddha: i.e.,
‘the Buddha, the lord of speech, spoke these verses’. Vilāsavajra and the Sanskrit witnesses
of the Nāmasaṅgīti, however, indicate that ‘the lord of speech’ refers to Mañjuśrī. The
latter reading and interpretation are, in our opinion, preferable on the grounds of grammar
and sense, and we therefore reflect it in our English translation.↑ These six mantras
are expressed in verse 27.↑ This mantra can be translated as follows: a ā i ī u ū e ai o au
aṃ aḥ—I, the Buddha, located in the heart, am the wisdom body of all buddhas residing throughout
the past, present, and future.↑ This mantra can be translated as follow: Oṃ, homage
to you, Arapacana—Vajratīkṣṇa (‘vajra-sharp’), Duḥkhaccheda (‘eliminator of suffering’),
Prajñājñānamūrti (‘embodiment of insight-wisdom’), Jñānakāya (‘wisdom body’), Vāgīśvara
(‘lord of speech’)!↑ The Sanskrit word akṣara (letter/phoneme/syllable) can also be understood
to refer to an imperishable thing. This understanding is reflected in the Kangyur’s translation
of the Nāmasaṅgīti: i.e., ‘He is the ultimate, imperishable thing’.↑  When used
in reference to letters, the word mahāprāṇa (translated here as ‘arising from great vital
force’) means ‘aspiration’, which would normally not apply to a vowel such as ‘a’. Vimalamitra
explains that the vowel ‘a’ is unique in not depending on the teeth, nose, tongue, and
so forth for its articulation; rather, it arises simply from prāṇa, a person’s vital force.
Thus the word mahāprāṇa connotes something that is naturally arisen from the vital force
alone.↑ We use the word ‘feast’ in the sense of a festival, particularly one that involves
religious worship.↑ Beginning in this verse the tantra lists the ten pāramitās: 1. generosity
(‘munificence’); 2. discipline; 3. patience (‘tolerance’); 4. diligence; 5. meditative
concentration; 6. wisdom; 7. skilful means; 8. strength; 9. aspiration (‘vows’); and
10. knowledge.↑ Vimalamitra understands what we translate as ‘great and daunting creatures’
(mahābhaya; ’jigs chen) to refer to non-Buddhist gods such as Viṣṇu and Śiva. Vilāsavajra,
similarly, understands the word to refer to Śiva in his Mahābhairava form.↑ Here we believe
that the majority of witnesses of the Tibetan translations have suffered from corruption,
with the word ‘rig’ becoming ‘rigs’. Following the corrupted text, we may translate
the name, ‘the best of the great families’. This reading, along with an interpretation of
it, appears to be common in Tibetan commentaries, including that of Vimalamitra. Witnesses
of the text reading ‘rig’ (vidyā) can also be found, and these are almost certainly to be
regarded as correct.↑ At face value, the Tibetan could be taken to mean ‘endowed with great
sageness’.↑ The ten grounds (bhūmi; sa) refer to stages of the path to awakening that a
bodhisattva traverses after having directly perceived reality.↑ The ten knowledges (daśa
jñānāni; shes pa bcu) are mentioned, for example, in Vasubandhu’s Abidharmakośa ch. 7. They
are knowledge of 1. dharma; 2. concordance; 3. conventions; 4. other minds; 5. suffering;
6. origin; 7. cessation; 8. the path; 9. exhaustion; 10. non-arising.↑ Commentators interpret
these enumerations variously: Vilāsavajra understands the “ten forms” to be the ten
ways of grasping to the self, which are taught in the third chapter of the Madhyāntavibhāga,
and he understands the “tenfold content” to comprise their remedies—i.e., the ten topics
of mastery (which are mentioned in the same work, and which also serve as the main topics
of Mipham Rinpoche’s Gateway to Knowledge). Vilāsavajra further explains that Mañjuśrī receives
such names because he can appear both as phenomena that are in discord with awakening
and as the remedies to such phenomena. Vimalamitra, by contrast, takes the “ten forms”
to be the five aggregates and the five mental afflictions, and the “tenfold content” to be
the five wisdoms and five bodies.↑ The ‘ten strength’ refer ten types of knowledge called
the powers (or strengths) of a tathāgata (tathāgatabala; de bzhin gshegs pa’i stobs)—namely,
knowledge of 1. what is correct and incorrect; 2. the results of actions; 3. the diverse
aspirations of beings; 4. the diverse dispositions of beings; 5. the quality of beings’
acumens; 6. the paths that lead in all directions; 7. all forms of meditative concentration
and the like; 8. past lives; 9. death and rebirth; and 10. the destruction of defilements.↑
Vilāsavajra and Vimalamitra both understand this to refer to the ten masteries (vaśitā;
dbang)—namely the power over 1. life; 2. mind; 3. material provisions; 4. action; 5. birth;
6. aspirations; 7. resolve; 8. supernatural powers; 9. Dharma; and 10. knowledge.↑ ‘Seekers’
(tīrthya; mu stegs) refers to those who seek liberation from suffering. They are
described as ‘misled’ or ‘bad’ insofar as they do not follow the Buddhist path, and they are
‘deer-like’ because they are terrified by the roar of the lion-like ‘no self’ doctrine.↑
Based on Vimalamitra’s commentary, which contains an alternative reading of the text found
only in certain witnesses of the Tibetan translation (kun tu ’gro ba’i don yod stobs),
we may translate the first quarter as, ‘he who has strength that is fruitful for all beings’.↑
Here ‘force’ (bala; stobs) is most naturally understood in the sense of military force.↑
Vilāsavajra explains that ‘rhino’ refers to a pratyekabuddha who leads a solitary life,
whereas the name ‘pratyekabuddha’ refers to one who congregates in groups.↑ ‘Equipped in
full with knowledge and its base’ (vidyācaraṇasampanna; rig pa dang zhabs su / rkang par
ldan pa) is a stock epithet for the Buddha and refers to knowledge and good conduct, or, more
technically, the Eightfold Path of the Nobles (namely, knowledge refers to right view,
and its “base”, or supporting factors, consists in the remaining seven branches).↑ ‘Accomplishing
all goals’ translates the Sanskrit siddhārtha, also a well-known name of Buddha Śākyamuni.↑
‘The Dharma source’ translates the Sanskrit dharmadhātu. An alternative translation
could be, for instance, the Dharma sphere.↑ Four of these five bodies are the dharmakāya,
svabhāvakāya, sambhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya. The fifth is given variously as ‘the body
of ripening’ (vipākakāya), ‘the body of wisdom-dharma’ (*jñānadharmakāya), or the vajra
body (vajrakāya). Vilāsavajra refers to the first of these, whereas Vimalamitra refers to
the third.↑ The five eyes, which are five organs of superior vision, are the bodily eye, divine
eye, insight eye, dharma eye, and buddha eye.↑ This translates the name Vairocana. The
name Mahā-vairocana occurs in verse 42.↑ The three families are those of body, speech,
and mind.↑ The foremost pledge (or great samaya) may, as Vilāsavajra suggests, refer to a
deity, or it may refer more generally to the pledges of the Vajrayāna.↑ A number of names
in this verse correspond to well-known deities: Amoghapāśa (translated as ‘with snare unfailing’)
is a form of Lokeśvara, while Vajrapāśa (translated as ‘the vajra snare’) and Vajrāṅkuśa
(translated as ‘the vajra hook’) are found as door-keepers in a number of maṇḍalas.↑
The 7th chapter begins with the last line of verse 66.↑ Alternatively, ‘the king of wrathful
deities’.↑ Halāhala is the poison that, according to Indic mythology, was produced during
the churning of the ocean.↑ This translates the name Yamāntaka. Yama can be understood
as the personification of death or as death’s messenger.↑ This translates the name Vighnarāja,
a common epithet for Gaṇeśa.↑ This translates the name Acala.↑ Here ‘immersion’ (āveśa,’bebs
pa) can be understood in the sense of ‘empowerment’, ‘blessing’, ‘possession’, or
simply ‘entry’.↑ According to Vilāsavajra, the meaning of this epithet is that Mañjuśrī
has knowledge of these four: truth, reality, reality’s peak, and selflessness (the commentator
glosses these four as slightly different aspects of ultimate reality).↑ ‘Unbounded liberation’
(apratiṣṭhitanirvāṇa; mi gnas pa’i mya ngan las ’das pa) refers to the state of
nirvāṇa that is bound to neither saṃsāra nor utter quiescence.↑ For Vimalamitra, ‘the trio’
here refers to the three poisons. Vilāsavajra interprets this name as meaning ‘the end of
the three’, and the three refer to the Truth of Suffering, the Truth of Origin, and the
Truth of Cessation; thus, Mañjuśrī is identified as the end of these three, the Truth of the
Path.↑ Throughout the Nāmasaṅgīti we translate upadhi as ‘substrate’, but the word as a
technical Buddhist term has a number of possible meanings, depending on context. For example,
it can also mean ‘remainder’, ‘body’, or ‘afflictions’. Tibetan translations of the Nāmasaṅgīti
and other texts render this term in various ways.↑ According to both Vimalamitra
and Vilāsavajra, the three forms of liberation are those of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and
buddhas.↑ ‘Cord-tied’ (mauñjin) indicates that Mañjuśrī wears the sacred cord of a brahmin.
In some witnesses of the text, this name is exchanged with the name ‘mauṇḍin’ from the
following verse, and this can be interpreted to mean that Mañjuśrī has a shaved head (as
a renunciate) or that he carries a skull cup (as a practitioner of extreme asceticism). The
Kangyur translation of the Nāmasaṅgīti indicates that ‘mauṇḍin’ was read both in this verse
and in the following. Regardless, commentators tend to agree that this portion of the
text shows how Mañjuśrī can appear with the garb and appearance of various Buddhist and non-Buddhist
religious practitioners.↑ More precisely, here two names should be understood:
‘he whose austerities are great’ and ‘he in whom austerities have culminated’.↑ A ‘brahmin’
is a member of the brahmin caste, ‘Brahmā’ refers to the deity known by that name, and
‘brahman’ can be understood as ultimate reality. Commentators vary in their accounts of how
these conventionally ‘Hindu’ terms relate to Mañjuśrī.↑ Vilāsavajra comments that ‘the branches
of awakening’ (vimokṣāṅga; rnam grol lus) are the seven branches of awakening and
the eight-branched path of noble beings. Vimalamitra, perhaps led by the Tibetan rendering
of the term ‘branch’ as ‘lus’ (‘body’), interprets as meaning ‘the body of awakening’—i.e.,
the body that is achieved on achieving full liberation.↑  The word śiva (translated here
as ‘quiescence’) may also be understood with the meaning ‘good’ or ‘beneficial’; or, although
not mentioned by commentators, it may refer to the god who bears the name Śiva.↑ The
names translated here as ‘devoid of passion’ and ‘passionless’ point toward the ‘guṇa’ of
‘rajas’, from the triad of ‘sattva’ (light/goodness), ‘rajas’ (passion/energy), and ‘tamas’
(darkness/inertia). This connection also suits the two names given in 98b, which connote
freedom from disease related to the three humours (which are in turn based on the three
‘guṇas’). The Tibetan translation of the word ‘rajas’ (i.e., ‘rdul’), while also referring
to the ‘guṇa’ in a technical context, can equally imply either a minute particle or a fault
(‘nyes skyon’).↑ Alternatively, Mañjuśrī is ‘Śrī’s beloved’ (śrīvatsa). According to Vailāsavajra,
a mark which has the shape of the so-called endless knot is situated uniquely
at the hearts of buddhas. Śrīvatsa is also a common epithet for Viṣṇu and the mark on his
chest.↑ The ‘lotus lord of dance’ translates Padmanarteśvara, a name commonly associated with
Lokeśvara.↑ Vilāsavajra appears to treat Vajraratna and so on (i.e. the names in verse
107–108a) as proper names, and he, as Vimalamitra does too, identifies them with, respectively,
Akṣobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitābha, Amoghasiddhi, and Vairocana.↑ Vilāsavajra explains
that the name ‘lotus buddhas’ is to be understood as a metaphorical comparison: the buddhas
are like lotus because they are free from stains.↑ The first three names mentioned in
this verse are also the names of well-known bodhisattvas: Samantabhadra, Sumati, and Kṣitigarbha.↑
Or, alternatively, ‘the glorious letter dhīḥ’.↑ According to Vilāsavajra, Śrīmat
refers to Padmanarteśvara, who is mentioned in verse 105.↑ The Sanskrit word translated here
as ‘the world’ is brahmāṇḍa, ‘Brahmā egg’, a term used more commonly in non-Buddhist texts
in reference to the universe.↑ Or ‘of great passion’ (mahārāga).↑ The four bases of miraculous
powers (catur-ṛddhipāda, rdzu ‘phrul gyi rkang pa bzhi) are: 1. intention (canda,
’dun pa); 2. diligence (vīrya, brtson ’grus); 3. attention (citta, sems pa); and 4. discernment
(mīmāṃsā, dpyod pa).↑ The four applications of mindfulness (catuḥ-smṛtyupasthāna,
dran pa nye bar bzhag pa bzhi) are mindfulness of 1. body (kāya, lus), 2. feelings (vedanā,
tshor ba), 3. mind (citta, sems), and 4. phenomena (dharma; chos).↑ A more literal translation
may be, ‘he who knows the reality of the objects [subsumed in] the five aggregates’.↑
According to the commentators, the ‘purity in all twelve forms’ refers to the twelve sense
sources (āyatana, skye mched) in their pure forms.↑ These eight knowledges are understood
by Vilāsavajra as follows: knowledge of Dharma, knowledge of non-duality, knowledge of
suffering, knowledge of the origin, knowledge of cessation, knowledge of the path, knowledge
of destruction, and knowledge of non-arising. Vimalamitra offers another interpretation:
Mañjuśrī realises that the eight forms of consciousness (from eye consciousness through
to the storehouse consciousness) are unarisen.↑ Vilāsavajra identifies these twelve forms
as the forms of the Four Truths as divided across the three turnings of the wheel of Dharma.
Vimalamitra, by contrast, enumerates the twelve as the five families (rigs lnga), the
five wisdoms (ye shes lnga), and insight (shes rab) and compassion (snying rje).↑ Vilāsavajra
explains that the sixteen forms referred to here are sixteen moments of realisation of
the Four Truths on the Path of Seeing. Vimalamitra enumerates these as the sixteen varieties
of emptiness.↑ Vilāsavajra enumerates these twenty forms as four ways in which each of
the five aggregates are not to be conceptualised. For example, by achieving awakening, one
does not believe that (1) material form is the self, (2) the self is within material form,
(3) material form is within the self, or (4) material form possesses the self. Multiplied
by the five aggregates, these add up to twenty forms. Vimalamitra, on the other hand, understands
these twenty forms to be the transformation of the five elements, the five aggregates,
the five afflictions, and the five faculties.↑ Vilāsavajra comments that ‘afflictive
spheres’ refer to the eighteen spheres (dhātu, khams) beginning with the eye sphere.↑ Vilāsavajra
explains that ‘oceanic floods’ are the traditionally enumerated four floods—namely,
the floods of desire, cyclic existence, views, and ignorance.↑ Vilāsavajra explains that
here the practice of yoga is compared to a dark forest, or ‘grove’, because it is not
easily traversed; Mañjuśrī has emerged from the practice of yoga and has arrived the state
of nirvāṇa.↑ According to Vilāsavajra, the words ‘all perceptions’ (sarvasaṃjñā) refer to
certain forms of mundane meditative concentration. Through these meditations, Mañjuśrī enters
a state of objectless awareness.↑ An alternate reading and interpretation of this verse
may be translated, ‘one who has reached the end of accomplishment, confusion free’.↑ Vilāsavajra
explains the final three cryptic names here as follows: ‘three objects’ are the
past, present, and future; ‘all objects’ are all objects of the animate and inanimate world;
and the ‘three properties’ are the three ‘guṇas’ most extensively described in Sāṅkhya
philosophy but well-known throughout all manner of Indic texts.↑ According to Vilāsavajra,
the three families are those of Vairocana, Akṣobhya, and Amitābha.↑ Vilāsavajra and Vimalamitra
both state that these syllables are the seeds of the five tathāgatas, but they diverge
regarding precisely how these syllables are to be identified.↑ Some witnesses of the text
in Sanskrit and Tibetan indicate that the name is ‘one with six syllables’. Vilāsavajra
identifies the six syllables as ‘oṃ vāgīśvara hūṃ’, while Vimalamitra, reading ‘one with
a hundred syllables’, interprets the hundred syllables as a generic large number that points
to all the various mantras for which Mañjuśrī is the source.↑ Vilāsavajra refrains from
offering a commentary on this line, but Vimalamitra clarifies that the four drops / bindus
(i.e. ‘half of half of sixteen’) are the seed syllables ‘a, ā, aṃ, aḥ’. This being a frequently
cited verse, a variety of highly esoteric interpretations can be found throughout
Indian and Tibetan tantric literature.↑ Pramathas are a class of beings otherwise known as
gaṇas. They are said to serve as attendants to Śiva.↑ The three names in this verse quarter
evoke the Vedic learning of a brahmin. Vilāsavajra understands ‘Knowing the three’ to
refer to the three Vedas: Ṛgveda, Yajurveda, and Sāmaveda. Vimalamitra comments that the three
are the scriptures of the tripiṭaka, or else three bodies of a buddha.↑ The six forms
of ‘higher knowledge’ (ṣaḍ-abhijñā, mngon shes drug) are as follows: 1. the divine eye (divyacakṣu,
lha’i mig), 2. the divine ear (divyasrotra, lha’i rna ba), 3. knowledge of other
minds (paracittajñāna; gzhan sems shes pa), 4. recollection of previous births (pūrvanivāsānusmṛti,
sngon gyi gnas rjes su dran pa), 5. miraculous powers (ṛddhi, rdzu ‘phrul), and
6. knowledge of the destruction of defilements (āśravakṣayajñāna, zag pa zad pa mkhyen pa).
The six forms of recollection, or ‘recall’, (ṣaḍanusmṛti, rjes su dran pa drug) are listed
variously in texts. According to the Mahāvyutpatti, they are recollection of 1. the Buddha,
2. the Dharma, 3. the Saṅgha, 4. discipline (śīla, tshul khrims), 5. giving (tyāga,
gtong ba), and 6. deities (devatā, lha). In their commentaries on the Nāmasaṅgīti, both Vimalamitra
and Vilāsavajra provide their own unique lists, which are more influenced by the
doctrines of tantric Buddhism.↑ The four seals (caturmudrā, phyag rgya bzhi) are the action
seal (karmamudrā, las kyi phyag rgya), the pledge seal (samayamudrā, dam tshig gi phyag
rgya), Dharma seal (dharmamudrā, chos kyi phyag rgya), and great seal (mahāmudrā, phyag
rgya chen po).↑ Oṃ—O you whose nature is the non-existence of all phenomena, whose vajra[-essence]
is fully pure—a ā aṃ aḥ! All phenomena are by nature completely pure—to explain,
[they are completely pure] based on their being the complete purity that is Mañjuśrī, the
wisdom body of all tathāgatas—a āḥ! Seize, seize the heart of all tathāgatas! Oṃ hūṃ hrīḥ—O
Blessed One, wisdom body, lord of speech, whose speech is great, who is all Dharma, whose
essence is the wisdom of the Dharma realm that is completely pure like stainless space—āḥ!↑
